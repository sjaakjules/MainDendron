@StanislavRoudavski Notes on a meeting with Mark, partly responding to his comments
Define in your methods:
What are your probes?
Existing terms and approaches to reserach

- speculations
- probes
- provocations
- experiments
- counter-factual
- hypothetical
  TODO: identify methods literature that is relevant, ask SR for suggestions if needed
- perhaps again make a simple table with some key approaches, definitions and positions; by discipline, types of data, types of actions, types of desired outcome. No need to be comprehensive. In this case, it is completely OK to cherry pick the methods that suit and stop at that, just contrasting them with alternatives to justify the choices.
  Recommendations:
  Ground your methods in existing methods
  Aim to have working definitions for your key terms so that you can answer what they are and why you call them things.
  Generally, I would not worry too much about the exact words as long as you are consistent.

  timeline comments.

- its not just achallange of witing. but research occurs through the writing. which illuminates exisitng theory and gap and contributions i claim.
- think it as compleating remaining research
- similar to practicle work. which aspects are supportant and supported by theoretical background. return to practical work to support theoretical enquiry to argue that more. and which to omit more.

subdivide time so writing is happening al lthe time and producing diagram and images that produce evedence.

regarding provocations:
look up experimental art. is it a probe, is it an experiment.
methods section to explain

- speculative deisgn speculatuons
- ideal theoretial approach. not recommendations but imagine the ideal situation.
- probe
- experiment
- law hyerthetical. counterfactual

Techniques. -- why identify materials??

- what is the intention of that chapter as my work is philisofical and techniques might not be nessessary.

- latest learing about plants
- action based research including plants that is contriversial

RMIT thesis --
notes on provocation - motivation for doing research.

Standard template for each provocation

- So what quesitons and implaications.
- role of plants in thei provocation
- implication for justice and health.

## Action Items <!-- Action items to be taken by specific attendees -->

- [x] Chase up access to CAPP
- [ ] Send review deferral forms once access to CAPP is given.
- [ ] Revise Capabilities mapping.
- [ ] Map projects, make full scope of taxonomy, show subset used in provocations.
- [ ] Review projects with updated capabilities in writing. example and demonstrations.
- [ ] Review provocations with capabilities. show what is extended and why its important (the so what).
- [ ] Review methods for provocation. create list of similar techniques. find articles to descibe them.

## Talking points

Hi everyone. hope you are all well.

Sorry for the mix up last week. I was late in sending the remainder and the documents. But we have meatier content to discuss today which is good.

As a reminder from our last meeting Mark. The administrative aspects.

- I had previously spoken with Carolyn who recommended a 3 month extension on the next review. This is instead of having an underwhelming performance review now and wasting the panels time.
- so i had an action item to fill out a form in the CAPP system.
- Since the financial new year i have lost my staff account which had all my PhD access on it. It should be linked to the student account but im an anomaly in the system and for me everything went though my staff account. I am in conversations with Carolyn who will ultimately approve the extension and who is in managing the renewal of my student access. I have chased it up with her 4 times now and it is stuck with People and Culture for weeks. New semester delays i presume.
- so letting you know its in the works and once i get access should be smooth sailing and we are fine to assume the paper work will go through.

Now onto this meeting.

The agenda has two items, timeline and chapter 6.
I think lets go over the timeline first. I will

- quickly recap what work remains through the thesis contents page.
- Then i will detail the timeline for remaining work to get me to submit by the end of june next year.

After that i was wanting to talk through Chapter 6. It is a bit messy and raw and I will discuss how i see this developing now as i talk through the remaining work and timeline.

With the actual content. Im going to overview the heading of this chapter and then detail what im working on at the minute. This work is becoming a prelude to what i imagine as the chapter and as i discussed will reside in earlier chapters.

This chapter details three provocations.

1. performing places
2. Exposing Places
3. Preserving places

Each one focuses
within each one it focuses on plants and different aspects of the research question. I have defined these demonstrations to help me focus the sections.
the first demonstrates how digital communication with plants in places can extend their capabilities. This work selects from

- Designerâ€™s digital models of plants can extend beyond physical representations to include ecological habitation and cultural relationships
