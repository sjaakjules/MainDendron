growth.
childhood - learnign youth
adulthood - reproduction
scenecence -

life history -
landscape architecture as a form of growth creation to link back to design.
plants have to move with changing climate.

introduced and movement of their life...

- connect to existing ecological assessment and design proposals,

my job is to say what is missing and what can be added through inclusion of plants as deisng participents rather then services, objects etc...

- movement is very different for different plants.
  say epiphyte has no roots or grass is trampled on... so its ok to be this an d that, dried up and so on.

demonstraight reason to look at plants as distinct and link back to capabilties which are damaged.

practice and literature within design action.

--- plants as clients -- movement and lifecycles.
when you have a plant you get their total change and growth..

without invovlement of humans they become designers of their own environement.

nourishment -
degrees of empowerment

- individuals
- communial aspect (mutalism)
- modify places and make them more livable
- communities are becoming more human - urban tree
- david haskel song of trees. if you are spuse 60% but hardy pear 80% but if you are known and supported then you can be 80% people water you etc.
- cross communication and cared for. supported within this human community. emails of trees.
  jenifer gabris -- ?
- not only to make human stories and care for them but to create multispecies interactions within the stories...
- multispecies is better because its less effort, more being are benefiting, waste is used for others etc.

use capabiltiies are they adderssing the full scope.

- Designer -- list and definition of hte player commitioners deisgers, stakeholders.
- pull that together, remind everyone what i have written.
- Do need to remind provocation, and why that is the word.
  The work is provocative to take reader to new territory... but tests or probes.

Functionings... capabilties rather then functionings...

massive change from start to now.

digital architecture -- first use fo a term
google tool to get a first use.

visual aspect - aethetics
bee electrical signals.

close something down, give a good reasing!
with aethetics - phylosiphy of platn aesthetics ro ecoaethetics - will give me enough that i know the topic and say why im not. rasisis interesting qwuestions and not relevent to this and that.
