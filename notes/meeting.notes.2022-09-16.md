Capabilities

If they can expels what they fo they can live a better life.
Its all about comparison
Before and after
Or with against the baseline

The so what is there is an improvement. That’s the demonstration.

Why labour ---

I need to define in a way that I believe…
Plants as designer, labour

Growth as landscape architecture. Plant based agriculture.
Understand cultuivate and train and then they can do more…

there are some open questions on all. your job is not to define once and for all but show that you know the evidence/context and to provide definitions that are defensible and work for your argument. you can also write more conventional ones and more abmitious ones and compare how they help in concrete case-studies

are plants persons? are plants designers? how?
support with scientific evidence, not fancy names
on the other hand, no need to dive deep into chemistry or DNA. use aggregate evidence as discussed in textbooks, reviews and people writing on the relevant conceptual topics

epigenetic and horizontal gene transfer and endosymbiosis are conceptually relevant though, i think to show how plants actually live

calling entities persons is optional. you either chose to do that or not. if you do, you need this. individuals organise in collectives, this is different. interesting for plants as they are less like individuals maybe... these entities might or might not design, in different ways.
The discussion for this should be in the chapters as appropriate. but you can decide on the definitions to guide it and update in parallel as understanding grows or with feedback

## Action Items <!-- Action items to be taken by specific attendees -->

Define terms
keep developing how projects are used. keep is clear and simple

start with: design/designer, person/personhood, community/participant/collaborator, plant/living being, design experiment/provocation, good or better life/flourishing/wellbeing for example
